The report provides data-driven insights to guide future marketing strategy and budget allocation decisions.

## Summary of Findings

This analysis of 1,800+ social media ad campaigns reveals a critical but fixable situation:
campaigns are losing money due to extremely low engagement, but the conversion process works well once users click through.

Paying $54.41 to acquire customers worth $50
* Each customer costs $4.41 in losses

## Conclusion

Our analysis shows the campaigns are losing money primarily due to extremely low click-through rates,
despite having an effective conversion process. The good news is this is fixable by pausing the worst performers, improving ad creatives, and scaling what works, we can quickly turn losses into strong profits. With focused execution, these campaigns have clear potential to become a major growth channel.
